Snow totals from this double-barreled storm system were impressive, especially in the mountains. Some of the totals included 50 inches of champaign powder at Alta, 44 inches at Snowbird, 42 inches at Brighton, 37 inches at Solitude, 36 inches at Silver Fork, 21 inches in Farmington Canyon and 12 inches in Park City. The Wasatch Front valleys and benches faired well too, with 10 inches on the North Salt Lake bench and Upper Millcreek, 8 inches in Sandy and Alpine, 6 inches in Holladay and 3 inches at the Salt Lake City International Airport. Much of the storm started as rain in the valleys, so the snow totals could have been much higher.",58
