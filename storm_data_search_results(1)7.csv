Winds rapidly increased behind a cold front passage on the evening of the 12th, with numerous wind gusts in excess of 50 mph.  Some of the highest gusts: 62 mph at Pellston (129 am on the 13th), 61 mph at Charlevoix (1014 pm on the 12th), 56 mph at Harbor Springs (1234 am on the 13th) and Oscoda (256 am on the 13th), 77 mph at the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (1108 pm on the 12th).  The highest wind gust in the region was 79 mph at the Presque Isle Lighthouse (548 am on the 13th).  Spotters reported wind gusts in excess of 55 mph at Manistee, Northport, and Ossineke.  The winds downed many trees and power lines across the region, producing widespread power outages.  In places, power was not restored until the 17th.  A utility company in northwest Lower Michigan called it the worst windstorm in 20 years - since the Edmund Fitzgerald storm.  Hartwick Pines State Park near Grayling lost over a dozen old-growth red and white pines -  the most damage from one storm since the Armistice Day windstorm of 1941.  Roof damage was reported in Manistee.

The winds also brought much colder air to the region, allowing rain associated with the low pressure system to change to snow.  Lake effect snow kicked in during the early morning hours on the 13th, gradually diminishing that afternoon.  Accumulations of 2 to 5 inches were common in north-central and northeast Lower Michigan, as well as in eastern Upper Michigan.  Combined with the strong winds, substantial blowing and drifting resulted anywhere even a few inches of snow fell.  Blizzard conditions occurred in Chippewa County, particularly in the central and eastern portions.  Elsewhere in the snowbelts, travel was still severely impaired in the overnight and morning hours.",208

Winds rapidly increased behind a cold front passage on the evening of the 12th, with numerous wind gusts in excess of 50 mph.  Some of the highest gusts: 62 mph at Pellston (129 am on the 13th), 61 mph at Charlevoix (1014 pm on the 12th), 56 mph at Harbor Springs (1234 am on the 13th) and Oscoda (256 am on the 13th), 77 mph at the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (1108 pm on the 12th).  The highest wind gust in the region was 79 mph at the Presque Isle Lighthouse (548 am on the 13th).  Spotters reported wind gusts in excess of 55 mph at Manistee, Northport, and Ossineke.  The winds downed many trees and power lines across the region, producing widespread power outages.  In places, power was not restored until the 17th.  A utility company in northwest Lower Michigan called it the worst windstorm in 20 years - since the Edmund Fitzgerald storm.  Hartwick Pines State Park near Grayling lost over a dozen old-growth red and white pines -  the most damage from one storm since the Armistice Day windstorm of 1941.  Roof damage was reported in Manistee.

The winds also brought much colder air to the region, allowing rain associated with the low pressure system to change to snow.  Lake effect snow kicked in during the early morning hours on the 13th, gradually diminishing that afternoon.  Accumulations of 2 to 5 inches were common in north-central and northeast Lower Michigan, as well as in eastern Upper Michigan.  Combined with the strong winds, substantial blowing and drifting resulted anywhere even a few inches of snow fell.  Blizzard conditions occurred in Chippewa County, particularly in the central and eastern portions.  Elsewhere in the snowbelts, travel was still severely impaired in the overnight and morning hours.",225

The frontal system associated with the storm moved over the west coast of Alaska on the 20th, producing blizzard conditions over portions of the northwest coast as well as strong winds through the central Alaska Range. As the low center intensified and moved over the west coast, blizzard conditions again visited the coastal areas, along with high winds. Heavy snow occured over portions of the interior of Alaska as the frontal system moved through on the 21st and 22nd.

Blizzard conditions were reported at:
Zone 208: Red Dog Mine
Zone 209: Kotzebue
Zone 213: Tin City
Zone 207: Point Hope; Shishmaref (In both locations, blizzard assumed as visibility sensor stopped reporting).

Zone 207: Shishmaref: Ground eroded to within 10 feet of the teacher's quarters; occupants were evacuated during the height of the storm.
Zone 211: The road to the village of Council was eroded in places. Snow fences (retards drifting snow near the city) were damaged in places. Damage total is $100,000 for the these two items.
Zone 212: Unalakleet: Additional damage to the gabion wall protecting the community (see event of Nov 8).  
Zone 213: Gambell: High waves; no further damage (from storm of the 7th). City of Diomede: Waves were 17 to 20 feet. Damages include losing the Diomede Clinic sled ($2000), loss of some building materials, severe damage to the seawall (gabion wall) which was protecting the high school, as well as a water and fuel tank facility. Amount of these more serious damages are unknown.
Zone 214: Kotlik: The bank erosion project completed in October was further damaged by the storm.
