A surface trough however bridged the two areas of low pressure. Meanwhile, an upper-level low tracked across the upper Ohio Valley and right across Pennsylvania late on the 19th, however it was weakening with time. This brought the first widespread accumulating snowfall of the season to northeastern Pennsylvania and even to some areas a little farther south. This storm was elevation dependent to some extent, as temperatures in the lower elevations were just above freezing during most of the event. The snow that did accumulate was heavy and wet and caused nearly 13,000 homes and businesses to lose power in the Lehigh Valley (where some trees still had leaves) and the Poconos. The storm system gradually moved off to the east on the 19th, bringing an end to the widespread precipitation.||Snow began falling in the Poconos just after Midnight EST on the 18th and fell heavy at times during the evening and night. The snow ended during the early afternoon on the 19th. In the Lehigh Valley, snow began falling around 7 a.m. EST on the 18th, but did not accumulate as efficiently as the Poconos as temperatures were at or above freezing. Most of the accumulating snow was over by sunrise on the 19th, but the snow did not end until around Noon EST on the 19th.

The rain changed to snow during the afternoon of the 18th in Berks County and the evening of the 18th in upper Bucks County. It ended during the morning of the 19th. Accumulations were very elevation dependent and ranged from only an inch or two in the valleys to around ten inches in the higher terrain of the Poconos.||In The Poconos, fallen trees caused about 6,000 homes and businesses to lose power. Power was not completely restored until the afternoon of the 20th. In Smithfield Township (Monroe County), two sixty-five foot red oak trees were downed by the snow onto the deck of one home. A large limb also damaged the chimney of that home. Fallen trees blocked several roads. In Monroe County, reported power outages caused by downed trees included Middle Smithfield, Smithfield, Hamilton and Ross Townships.  Throughout the Poconos, most schools had delayed openings on the 19th (a Monday); a few were closed for the day. Many accidents were caused by the snow.
