Temperatures were estimated likely fell to, or below, freezing around or a little after 530 AM on the 5th toward the immediate coast.  By daybreak, the measured low temperatures on the west side of the Laguna Madre ranged from 30 degrees in Port Isabel and Bayview to 32 degrees at the Laguna Atascosa/Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge near the Laguna Madre southeast of Arroyo City. Slightly lower temperatures may have occurred in normally colder locations away from the bay.  In the Town of South Padre Island, warming influence from the Bay and Gulf kept temperatures from dropping below the mid 30s.||The freeze was accompanied by frost, which combined with calm winds minimized notable damage to temperature sensitive crops.  Unprotected plants at individual residences may have received some damage, but costs were unknown.","A deep trough of mid level low pressure, extending from the Upper Midwest southwest into Texas brought a period of cold rain and snow to South Texas on the 4th.  When the clouds cleared at the end of an unusually cold afternoon on the 4th, Canadian high pressure overspread the region overnight on the 4th and into the 5th, bringing the coldest surface temperatures in nearly 5 years to all of Deep South Texas. ||Morning lows on the 5th dropped to the mid 20s to around 30 in all counties, with freezing or lower temperatures lasting up to 6 hours in typically colder pockets.  The freeze was frosty for many critical agricultural areas of the Rio Grande Valley; temperatures hovering just below 32 combined with calm winds limited notable damage to protected crops and plants.",437
