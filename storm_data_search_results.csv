The event started on November 9 with a closed upper air (500 mb) low over Lake Superior combined with northwest winds between Arctic high pressure in Alberta and a surface low in southern Quebec with an east-west oriented trough across Lake Superior. Heavy snow began  around midnight on Nov 9 in the Ironwood area and spread east to the Keweenaw Peninsula during the daylight hours on the 9th. Meanwhile, another band of heavy snow was established over Munising in central Alger county during the day on the 9th. 

The upper low slowly lifted north and opened into a trough by 7 am on the 10th. The surface trough meanwhile moved south of Upper Michigan. This produced a wind shift from northwest to north during the early morning hours of the 10th that shifted the heavy snows over Munising to western Alger county and eastern Marquette counties. 

When the Arctic high moved southeast to Minnesota on the 12th, the winds shifted back to northwest shifting the lake effect snow to Alger and Luce Counties. Whereas the snow slowly diminished in intensity as the high reached Upper Michigan, it did not stop completely until winds shifted to the southwest the morning of the 14th.

The event started on November 9 with a closed upper air (500 mb) low over Lake Superior combined with northwest winds between Arctic high pressure in Alberta and a surface low in southern Quebec with an east-west oriented trough across Lake Superior. Heavy snow began  around midnight on Nov 9 in the Ironwood area and spread east to the Keweenaw Peninsula during the daylight hours on the 9th. Meanwhile, another band of heavy snow was established over Munising in central Alger county during the day on the 9th. 

The upper low slowly lifted north and opened into a trough by 7 am on the 10th. The surface trough meanwhile moved south of Upper Michigan. This produced a wind shift from northwest to north during the early morning hours of the 10th that shifted the heavy snows over Munising to western Alger county and eastern Marquette counties. 

When the Arctic high moved southeast to Minnesota on the 12th, the winds shifted back to northwest shifting the lake effect snow to Alger and Luce Counties. Whereas the snow slowly diminished in intensity as the high reached Upper Michigan, it did not stop completely until winds shifted to the southwest the morning of the 14th.

The storm wreaked havoc on power and telephone lines.  Cleveland Electric Illuminating estimated 185,000 customers were without power, some for several days.  Dozens of emergency shelters were opened for people who were without electricity.  In Wickliffe and Willoughby (Lake County), motels and hotels that still had power, were sold out.

The ground was already saturated at the beginning of the storm causing shallow rooted trees to topple.
