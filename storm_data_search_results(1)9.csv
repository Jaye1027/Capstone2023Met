The freezing rain changed to snow on the 28th and northwest winds increased to 30 to 40 mph gusting to 60 mph. The high winds and heavy ice accumulations caused several thousand power poles (some steel) along with several thousand miles of power lines to come down resulting in widespread power outages. The ice and wind also damaged several hundred miles of high voltage power lines and towers. Some power substations were also shut down by the ice and wind.  Also, thousands of trees were either damaged or downed due to the heavy ice accumulations and wind.  Many of the fallen trees and branches caused damage to homes and vehicles. The radio station in Milbank went off the air due to its tower collapsing.  Tens of thousands of people in many communities and rural areas were without power for several days with some people without power for as much as two weeks.  Telephone and cellular phone service was also down for several days.  Countless schools, businesses, government offices, and other organizations were closed for several days. FEMA, state officials, and the governor toured the damaged area resulting in a presidential disaster declaration.

Hundreds of utility workers from South Dakota and ten surrounding states worked 14 to 18 hour days in very cold conditions to bring power back to the area. The national guard also helped with getting generators, cots, blankets, and meals to storm shelters.  Generators supplied power to many communities and rural areas while others continued without power. Shelters were set up for those who did not have generator power or another place to go. There were also problems with livestock with the water supplies cutoff for some time.  One electric cooperative stated that repairs to the infrastructure will continue for months and years to restore a system that took decades to build.

Roads were treacherous with many accidents and rollovers with some resulting in injuries. Due to the poor road conditions, many roads were closed along with Interstate 29.  Around noon on the 27th on U.S. Highway 212 two miles west of Zell in Faulk county, a 59-year old man was killed when his car spun out of control and hit an oncoming pickup truck.

Air traffic was also brought to a halt across much of the area.  This was one of the worst ice storms in the state's history. One electric cooperative said is was the worst damage they had in their 65 years of existence.

The freezing rain changed to snow on the 28th and northwest winds increased to 30 to 40 mph gusting to 60 mph. The high winds and heavy ice accumulations caused several thousand power poles (some steel) along with several thousand miles of power lines to come down resulting in widespread power outages. The ice and wind also damaged several hundred miles of high voltage power lines and towers. Some power substations were also shut down by the ice and wind.  Also, thousands of trees were either damaged or downed due to the heavy ice accumulations and wind.  Many of the fallen trees and branches caused damage to homes and vehicles. The radio station in Milbank went off the air due to its tower collapsing.  Tens of thousands of people in many communities and rural areas were without power for several days with some people without power for as much as two weeks.  Telephone and cellular phone service was also down for several days.  Countless schools, businesses, government offices, and other organizations were closed for several days. FEMA, state officials, and the governor toured the damaged area resulting in a presidential disaster declaration.

Hundreds of utility workers from South Dakota and ten surrounding states worked 14 to 18 hour days in very cold conditions to bring power back to the area. The national guard also helped with getting generators, cots, blankets, and meals to storm shelters.  Generators supplied power to many communities and rural areas while others continued without power. Shelters were set up for those who did not have generator power or another place to go. There were also problems with livestock with the water supplies cutoff for some time.  One electric cooperative stated that repairs to the infrastructure will continue for months and years to restore a system that took decades to build.

Roads were treacherous with many accidents and rollovers with some resulting in injuries. Due to the poor road conditions, many roads were closed along with Interstate 29.  Around noon on the 27th on U.S. Highway 212 two miles west of Zell in Faulk county, a 59-year old man was killed when his car spun out of control and hit an oncoming pickup truck.  And around 130 pm on the 28th on Day County road one about two miles south of Waubay, a 17-year old girl was killed and three others were injured when one vehicle spun out of control and struck another truck in the oncoming lane.  Air traffic was also brought to a halt across much of the area.  This was one of the worst ice storms in the state's history. One electric cooperative said is was the worst damage they had in their 65 years of existence.

The freezing rain changed to snow on the 28th and northwest winds increased to 30 to 40 mph gusting to 60 mph. The high winds and heavy ice accumulations caused several thousand power poles (some steel) along with several thousand miles of power lines to come down resulting in widespread power outages. The ice and wind also damaged several hundred miles of high voltage power lines and towers. Some power substations were also shut down by the ice and wind.  Also, thousands of trees were either damaged or downed due to the heavy ice accumulations and wind.  Many of the fallen trees and branches caused damage to homes and vehicles. The radio station in Milbank went off the air due to its tower collapsing.  Tens of thousands of people in many communities and rural areas were without power for several days with some people without power for as much as two weeks.  Telephone and cellular phone service was also down for several days.  Countless schools, businesses, government offices, and other organizations were closed for several days. FEMA, state officials, and the governor toured the damaged area resulting in a presidential disaster declaration.

Hundreds of utility workers from South Dakota and ten surrounding states worked 14 to 18 hour days in very cold conditions to bring power back to the area. The national guard also helped with getting generators, cots, blankets, and meals to storm shelters.  Generators supplied power to many communities and rural areas while others continued without power. Shelters were set up for those who did not have generator power or another place to go. There were also problems with livestock with the water supplies cutoff for some time.  One electric cooperative stated that repairs to the infrastructure will continue for months and years to restore a system that took decades to build.

Roads were treacherous with many accidents and rollovers with some resulting in injuries. Due to the poor road conditions, many roads were closed along with Interstate 29.  Around noon on the 27th on U.S. Highway 212 two miles west of Zell in Faulk county, a 59-year old man was killed when his car spun out of control and hit an oncoming pickup truck.  And around 130 pm on the 28th on Day County road one about two miles south of Waubay, a 17-year old girl was killed and three others were injured when one vehicle spun out of control and struck another truck in the oncoming lane.  Air traffic was also brought to a halt across much of the area.  This was one of the worst ice storms in the state's history. One electric cooperative said is was the worst damage they had in their 65 years of existence.  After the icing came snowfall of 2 to 12 inches which combined with the high winds to bring blizzard conditions and low wind chills to northeast South Dakota from the morning of the 28th until the early morning of the 29th.  Some of the significant snowfall amounts included, 7 inches at Watertown, 8 inches at Waubay, 10 inches at Redfield, and 12 inches at Sisseton.",422

Strong winds which accompanied the ice storm and the immediately following blizzard combined with the weight of the ice to bring down many of the power lines and poles. Tens of thousands of households and businesses lost power, with the time power was out ranging from most of a day, to two or three weeks in some rural areas. Even a few communities were without power for extended periods, such as more than 5 days at Avon and Wessington Springs, and 9 days at Woonsocket. The damage to power poles and lines was so extensive that repairs done in the following days and weeks required assistance from crews which came from other states such as North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Montana, Missouri, and Kansas. The power loss resulted in numerous additional problems, including loss of refrigeration, freezing, and cooking capacity, lack of heating, loss of telephone service, and the loss of water service. Indirect damage also occurred, such as damage to computers caused by generator power fluctuations. The loss of heat and utilities and food problems forced many people to take emergency shelter during and after the storm in such varied places as schools, nursing homes, community centers, churches, fire stations, and courthouses where commercial or generator power was available. Medical care was made unavailable or seriously hampered by the lack of power and the difficulties or impossibility of transportation. Even mail delivery was temporarily halted in many areas. Tree damage was extensive, with some vehicles and buildings suffering damage from falling trees. Livestock losses were suspected because of difficulties in making food and water available, although emergency assistance in the days following the storm helped. Aside from law enforcement and other emergency personnel, the National Guard was activated for emergency operations including rescue work.",430

The freezing rain changed to snow on the 28th and northwest winds increased to 30 to 40 mph gusting to 60 mph. The high winds and heavy ice accumulations caused several thousand power poles (some steel) along with several thousand miles of power lines to come down resulting in widespread power outages. The ice and wind also damaged several hundred miles of high voltage power lines and towers. Some power substations were also shut down by the ice and wind.  Also, thousands of trees were either damaged or downed due to the heavy ice accumulations and wind.  Many of the fallen trees and branches caused damage to homes and vehicles. The radio station in Milbank went off the air due to its tower collapsing.  Tens of thousands of people in many communities and rural areas were without power for several days with some people without power for as much as two weeks.  Telephone and cellular phone service was also down for several days.  Countless schools, businesses, government offices, and other organizations were closed for several days. FEMA, state officials, and the governor toured the damaged area resulting in a presidential disaster declaration.

Hundreds of utility workers from South Dakota and ten surrounding states worked 14 to 18 hour days in very cold conditions to bring power back to the area. The national guard also helped with getting generators, cots, blankets, and meals to storm shelters.  Generators supplied power to many communities and rural areas while others continued without power. Shelters were set up for those who did not have generator power or another place to go. There were also problems with livestock with the water supplies cutoff for some time.  One electric cooperative stated that repairs to the infrastructure will continue for months and years to restore a system that took decades to build.

Roads were treacherous with many accidents and rollovers with some resulting in injuries. Due to the poor road conditions, many roads were closed along with Interstate 29.  Around noon on the 27th on U.S. Highway 212 two miles west of Zell in Faulk county, a 59-year old man was killed when his car spun out of control and hit an oncoming pickup truck.  And around 130 pm on the 28th on Day County road one about two miles south of Waubay, a 17-year old girl was killed and three others were injured when one vehicle spun out of control and struck another truck in the oncoming lane.  Air traffic was also brought to a halt across much of the area.  This was one of the worst ice storms in the state's history. One electric cooperative said is was the worst damage they had in their 65 years of existence.

The storm caused blizzard conditions across a large part of central and northeast Nebraska, and shut down a 220-mile stretch of Interstate 80 much of Monday.  The Interstate remained closed into Tuesday morning.  In addition, many, if not most, other roads in central and northeast Nebraska were closed for at least a time during the storm.  Major highways in northeast Nebraska that were closed included Highway 81 north of Columbus and Highway 275 around Norfolk.  Many vehicles were stranded on roads or slid or drove into ditches.  In fact at one point it was reported that 100 vehicles were stalled on Highway 81 in only a 20 mile stretch between Columbus and Humphrey. The storm also brought severe thunderstorms to southeast Nebraska Sunday afternoon into Sunday night.

In northeast Nebraska the precipitation began as rain Sunday afternoon, changing over to freezing rain Sunday evening.  Significant ice accumulations began after midnight on the 28th, mainly from Albion and Neligh north and northeast into Knox, Madison and Pierce counties.  Ice accumulations of 1/4 to 1/2 inch or even more were common from Neligh through Pierce, Bloomfield and Niobrara.  Some locations in Antelope and Boone counties reported over 1 inch ice accumulations on power line equipment.  When winds picked up Sunday night, many tree branches and power lines and poles were downed because of the ice accumulations.  As a result, power was lost for at several hours, and in some cases for several days, across much of the area west through north of Norfolk. Three radio stations in Norfolk were knocked off the air by the wind and ice, and the combination of wind and ice also overturned many center pivot irrigation systems throughout the region.  The freezing rain began changing to snow late Sunday evening or early Monday from northwest to southeast, and by mid Monday morning a raging blizzard was underway from Norfolk and locations north through southwest.  Blizzard conditions spread southeast to Columbus, Stanton and Wayne during the afternoon.  

Heavier snow accumulations from the storm included 13 inches in Bloomfield, 12 inches in Niobrara, 10 inches in Crofton, 9 inches at Neligh, 7 inches in Madison and 6 inches at Stanton and Norfolk.  In addition to the snow, very strong winds were reported throughout the region, with sustained winds of 40 mph or more and frequent gusts over 50 mph common.  The strong winds caused some 5 to 15 foot drifts, especially north of an Albion to Norfolk line.  Some gusts of 50 knots or greater (58 mph) were also recorded.  Higher wind gusts and times (all cst) measured by Asos or Awos included...64 mph at Columbus at 255 pm, 59 mph in Norfolk at 507 pm, 52 mph at Albion at 1010 am and 51 mph at Wayne at 410 pm.  The Albion sensor could have been under-reporting wind speeds due the freezing rain that fell earlier because peak wind gusts of around 60 mph or greater were common at other sites in between Norfolk and central Nebraska.

At least one indirect fatality was recorded from the storm in northeast Nebraska.  A head-on collision occurred Monday morning near Humphrey, near the junction of Highways 81 and 91 north of Columbus, when a driver crossed the center line in near white-out conditions and was struck by a semi-tractor trailer.
