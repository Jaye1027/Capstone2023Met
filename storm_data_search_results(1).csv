The first lake effect snow event of the season brought very localized heavy wet snow to the immediate lake shore communities from Grand Haven and Ferrysburg south into far western Van Buren County. Accumulating snow only extended about 10-12 miles inland across western portions of Ottawa, Allegan, and Van Buren Counties. Most locations from Grand Haven south to South Haven received 2-3 inches of snow, but a nearly stationary snow band which developed over southwest Allegan County resulted in snow accumulations of 8-10 inches in both Glenn and Ganges, along and west of Interstate 196, in Ganges Township. The weight of the heavy, wet snow caused tree limbs to snap, which resulted in downed power lines around 7:00 AM in Ferrysburg and Spring Lake Township.

A cold front moved across western Lower Michigan during the early morning hours of November 12th, resulting in a lake-enhanced snow event which began late evening, Tuesday, November 11th. In general, 1 to 5 inches of snow fell across western and southern Lower Michigan, with 3 to 5 inch amounts confined to Lake, Ottawa, Kent, Allegan, Barry, Eaton, Ingham, and Kalamazoo Counties. The snow-covered and icy roads caught many overnight and early morning motorists by surprise. Slippery conditions are believed to have contributed to a seven-car pile-up on the northbound span of the U.S. 31 drawbridge late Tuesday night in Grand Haven. Two injuries were reported. The snow initially melted on road surfaces overnight, then froze early Wednesday morning as temperatures fell below freezing. This resulted in extremely icy conditions and an unusually high number of minor accidents, which included many slide-offs into ditches. Accidents with injuries were reported in Battle Creek, St. Joseph and Cass Counties, Hillsdale County (a rollover accident), and  Branch, Mecosta, Osceola, and Newaygo Counties. Snow reports included 5.0 inches in Grandville, 4.8 inches at the National Weather Service Office in southeast Grand Rapids, 4.5 inches in Hudsonville, 3.6-4.0 inches in Allegan, 3.2 inches in Hastings, 3.0 inches in Oshtemo, 3.0 inches in East Lansing, and 1.5 inches in Battle Creek.",109

An intense band of lake effect snow developed down the length of eastern Lake Michigan in a north wind flow and resulted in snow accumulations of 6 to 18 inches across far western Van Buren County and most of Berrien County. As the wind flow turned slightly more northwest during the morning hours of Sunday, November 16th, lake effect snow bands moved further inland across western Ottawa, western Allegan, central Van Buren, and Cass Counties. Snow totals in these areas ranged from 2 to 5 inches by the time the lake effect diminished. The worst conditions were felt across southwest Berrien County, where storm accumulations reached 18 inches in the New Buffalo-Sawyer areas. The weight of the heavy, wet snow downed tree limbs and power lines which cut power to 3,000 American Electric Power customers in southwest Berrien County. Snow reports included 13 inches in Baroda, 12 inches in St. Joseph and Coloma, 11 inches in Buchanan, 10 inches in Stevensville, 6 inches in South Haven, 4.7 inches in Holland, and 4.5 inches in Fennville.",407
