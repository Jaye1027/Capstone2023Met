Much of the freezing rain fell across central and north central South Dakota west of the Missouri River. As the freezing rain changed over to snow and the winds increased, the ice and snow buildup on the power lines and poles caused hundreds of power poles to break across Jones, Stanley, Dewey, and Corson counties. East of the Missouri River, the colder air and stronger winds moved in changing the rain over to snow. Strong winds of 30 to 45 mph with gusts near 60 mph brought widespread blizzard conditions to all of the area.||Ice buildup from the freezing rain ranged from a tenth to as much as an inch for counties west of the Missouri River. Snowfall amounts across the entire area generally ranged from 2 to 8 inches with a 15 inch amount recorded in southwest Corson County.  Some of the snowfall amounts included: 3 inches at Eagle Butte, Blunt, Kennebec, Mission Ridge, and Onida; 4 inches at Pollock, Gettysburg, and Bowdle; 5 inches south of Harrold, Iona, and near McIntosh; 6 inches at Mobridge; 7 inches at Murdo; 8 inches at McLaughlin, and 15 inches southwest of Keldron.||All 4,600 customers of the Moreau-Grand Electric company lost power due to the storm. The last time this occurred was during the winter of 1967-68. The monetary loss to this cooperative and other electric cooperatives for Jones, Stanley, Corson, and Dewey counties was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. There were over 100 line workers working countless hours with crews coming from as far away as Nebraska and Iowa to assist in the power recovery. Over 1,000 customers were without power for an extended period of time.  Cell phone coverage was also knocked out for parts of the West River area due to downed towers.||The blizzard resulted in numerous school, business, and road closures along with flight cancellations.

Later Thursday morning the storm system's dry slot worked into the Bismarck area cutting off precipitation altogether, at least temporarily.||By daybreak Thursday morning, as the initial TROWAL feature was dissipating across western North Dakota, a secondary TROWAL developed over southern Alberta and advancing south into north central North Dakota. Colder air aloft had also advected across the entire area by mid morning Thursday. By early Thursday afternoon, this secondary TROWAL continued to advance south, producing a band of heavy snow which lasted through Thursday night, and finally decreased Friday morning.||Additionally, strong north to northwest winds accompanying the snow produced widespread blizzard conditions central, with blizzard conditions continuing southwest due to the strong winds and existing heavy snow cover.||Conditions slowly improved statewide Friday as areas of snow dissipated and the strong northwest winds diminished. Storm total snowfall ranged from one to three inches around Williston and Jamestown, to six to twelve inches southwest through central, to a maximum of twenty inches in McHenry County.

Much of the freezing rain fell across central and north central South Dakota west of the Missouri River. As the freezing rain changed over to snow and the winds increased, the ice and snow buildup on the power lines and poles caused hundreds of power poles to break across Jones, Stanley, Dewey, and Corson counties. East of the Missouri River, the colder air and stronger winds moved in changing the rain over to snow. Strong winds of 30 to 45 mph with gusts near 60 mph brought widespread blizzard conditions to all of the area.||Ice buildup from the freezing rain ranged from a tenth to as much as an inch for counties west of the Missouri River. Snowfall amounts across the entire area generally ranged from 2 to 8 inches with a 15 inch amount recorded in southwest Corson County.  Some of the snowfall amounts included: 3 inches at Eagle Butte, Blunt, Kennebec, Mission Ridge, and Onida; 4 inches at Pollock, Gettysburg, and Bowdle; 5 inches south of Harrold, Iona, and near McIntosh; 6 inches at Mobridge; 7 inches at Murdo; 8 inches at McLaughlin, and 15 inches southwest of Keldron.||All 4,600 customers of the Moreau-Grand Electric company lost power due to the storm. The last time this occurred was during the winter of 1967-68. The monetary loss to this cooperative and other electric cooperatives for Jones, Stanley, Corson, and Dewey counties was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. There were over 100 line workers working countless hours with crews coming from as far away as Nebraska and Iowa to assist in the power recovery. Over 1,000 customers were without power for an extended period of time.  Cell phone coverage was also knocked out for parts of the West River area due to downed towers.||The blizzard resulted in numerous school, business, and road closures along with flight cancellations. Interstate-90 was shut down from Mitchell, South Dakota to the Wyoming border from Thursday the 6th until Friday evening of the 7th. Many semi trucks and cars were stranded along the Interstate with many people being rescued. Many travelers took shelter in Murdo, Chamberlain, and Pierre until the Interstate reopened Friday evening. There were also several accidents across the area with a serious accident in Walworth county on Highway 83 near the Potter county line.  In the early afternoon hours of Friday the 7th, slippery roads, high winds, and low visibilities contributed to the rollover of a passenger van carrying seven students. The passenger van rolled several times causing serious injuries to three of the students. Also, a semi truck rolled over on an icy and snowy Highway 45 south of Miller in the late afternoon hours of the 6th. The driver received minor injuries.

An addition, scattered thunderstorms in east-central North Dakota prompted one severe thunderstorm warning and yielded a report of large hail in Stutsman County. Farther west, rain quickly changed over to all snow Wednesday evening as colder air was pulled into the system.||Moderate to heavy snow continued across western North Dakota Wednesday night into Thursday morning, coinciding with increasing northwesterly winds which produced widespread blizzard conditions over the southwest part of the state.

Several inches fell during the afternoon. Meanwhile, a weak secondary front and wind shift dropped south across New York and set up from near Erie across Pennsylvania to near Philadelphia. A band of heavy snow set up along this convergence line, fed at its western end by Lake Erie. This band dropped just to the south of Chautauqua County during the evening, after 6 to 8 inch totals. Winds turned north-northeasterly and another band set up from Dunkirk to Ripley which became heavy overnight and early Friday morning as winds backed to north-northwest. Six to twelve inches fell during this phase along the lakeshore. The flow turned strong northwest later Friday and remained so through Saturday. This flow was unusually cold for November but very dry, so multiple bands formed off Lake Ontario and continued for 36 to 48 hours. Total snowfall for the entire event exceeded a foot over most of Chautauqua County. Eight to fourteen inches fell for the period from Wayne to Oswego counties. Specific snowfall reports included: 18��� at Mayville, 16��� at Westfield, 14��� at Jamestown and West Monroe; 12 inches at Cherry Hill; 11��� at Dunkirk; 10��� at Ripley, Oswego and Palymra; and 8��� at Cato.",397
