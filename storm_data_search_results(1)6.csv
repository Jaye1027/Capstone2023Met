What was unusual for this area was the change from the normal summer/fall dry conditions to the wet season in such dramatic fashion with little in the way of transition. During the period in the Southern Sierra Nevada 46" of new snow fell at Volcanic Knob and Upper Burnt Corral; and in the Tulare County Mountains 80" fell at Chagoopa Plateau.  Numerous foothill locations received 5-10" of rain within the 3-day period in the foothills of the Southern Sierra Nevada.  Johnsondale, in Tulare County received 16.38" of rain in the 3-day period.  On the San Joaquin Valley floor Merced received 1.80" in 3 days, Fresno 1.76"; Hanford 1.44"; and, Bakersfield 1.29."

This air was cold enough to produce a heavy wintery mix of precipitation during a good portion of the storm across Litchfield County. Generally speaking, 1-3 inches of snow fell as the precipitation arrived late on Saturday morning. As warmer air moved in aloft, the precipitation gradually changed to sleet, then an extended period of freezing rain. The freezing rain produced a buildup of ice between a half and one inch thick on many surfaces. Winds, frequently gusting to around 30 mph combined with the ice and residual leaves left on the trees, to bring many of them down. The ice and wind also brought down a number of power lines. The net result from this storm was one of the greatest power outages ever in Litchfield County. At one point, during the overnight hours of the 17th, well over 50 percent of customers in the county were without power! Many trees were uprooted and some roads were impassable due to the ice and downed debris. Surface temperatures finally rose above the freezing mark later on Sunday morning, thus ending additional icing. As colder air worked back in, some snow fell on the back side of the storm, but additional accumlations were fairly minor. Many businesses and schools were closed up to several days after the storm and it took the better part of a  week to completely restore power.","",190
