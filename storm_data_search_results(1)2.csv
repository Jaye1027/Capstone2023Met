The impact and shock knocked him to the ground, and he received minor injuries. Lightning also struck a house in Magna causing some minor damage. Lightning also struck a tree in West Jordan, knocking a branch through a bedroom window, hitting a computer, 2 VCR's, a satellite dish and 2 TV's. Nobody was hurt in the incident. Snowfall from the storm was generally 2-6 inches in most valleys, with 4-10 inches along the benches and 1-2 feet in the mountains.
